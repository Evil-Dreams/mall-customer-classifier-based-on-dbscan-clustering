# Mall Customer Classification using DBSCAN

This project uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to classify mall customers based on their spending behavior and demographic features. The goal is to identify natural customer groups without pre-defining the number of clusters.

The dataset is processed and normalized before applying DBSCAN. The algorithm groups customers based on density and also detects noise or outliers. The results help understand different customer segments and unusual spending patterns.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used along with data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

This project can be useful in customer segmentation, targeted marketing, business strategy, and anomaly detection.
